# EU Directive 96/53/EC - Weights & Dimensions

## Harmonized Limits
Council Directive 96/53/EC establishes the maximum authorized dimensions in national and international traffic and the maximum authorized weights.

### Maximum Authorized Weights (International Traffic)
- **5-axle or 6-axle combination**: 40 tonnes.
- **ISO Containers (45ft)**: 44 tonnes (Combined transport).

### Application Relevance
Since TLC4Pipe focuses on domestic/regional transport standards (common in Romania/Eastern Europe), we adhere to the **40t / 24t Payload** standard.

### Safety Margins
While the law allows 24t, practical logistics suggests a **safety margin of 500kg**.
The application does not currently enforce this margin automatically but displays the total weight clearly (e.g., 23,950 kg) allowing the loading manager to make the final call.

### Load Securing (EN 12195-1)
EU rules require calculation of lashing forces.
- **Friction**: HDPE is slippery ($\mu = 0.2$).
- **Requirement**: Use of **Anti-Slip Mats** ($\mu = 0.6$) is strongly recommended to reduce the number of required straps.
